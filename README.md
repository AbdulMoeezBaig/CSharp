### Things To Remember
1. Console.Write() --> Console is the class name, write is the method. The "." in between is a member access operator  
2. Methods have () after it. () is called the method invocation operator  
3. Double Quotes " " inclose a string called a "Literal String", use single quotes for characters
4. Literal value = constant that never changes
5. Data Types (char, string, int, float, double, decimal, bool ), append at end (0.0012312F) F or f for float, M or m for Decimal

### Coding Style
